# 'Tox' is a tool for automating sdist/build/test cycles against
# multiple Python versions:
#   https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#
# Running the command 'tox' while in the source root directory will
# create, install, and test a distribution for each supported python
# version. Multiple versions of Python can be installed using 'pyenv'.
# To run against a specific Python version, use:
#   tox -e py27
